# Learning-Based Forward Kinematics and Its Inverse Kinematics Implementation for Concentric-Tube Robots

## Introduction
This repository contains the accompanying dataset of our paper "Learning-Based Forward Kinematics and Its Inverse Kinematics Implementation for Concentric-Tube Robots" published in IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics.
The dataset contains 32,000 CTR configuration samples, which was collected from a CTR prototype using optical tracking system (Polaris Vicra, NDI Inc.).
